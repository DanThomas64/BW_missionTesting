[spoiler=Pre-mission Checklist + Notes]

[list]

[*]Ensure only slots that are meant to be played are in the mission. :  [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Do a quick sanity check of the ratio. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Make sure the mission description isn't confusing/vague. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Read the briefings make sure they exist and are clear. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Make sure objectives are marked. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Take a quick look at the map for terrain imbalances, and make sure the mission maker has taken them into account (I.E.
defenders need better gear and/or more people if they're defending a bowl that has sparse cover). : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure there is a signals tab, and the channel names make sense for the mission. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure that if it is a night mission it is tagged as such in the mission description on the slotting screen. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[size=150][u][color=#00BFFF]Gear Checklist[/color][/u] [color=#00FF00]PASS[/color][/size]

[spoiler=Gear Checklist + Notes]

[list]

[*]Ensure every soldier has the correct number of magazines/rockets. You can use the Pabst supply tool to get a good idea of this. (Hit Escape and go to the Admin tools. Run the Supply check. The readout will be placed in your briefing.) :  [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure soldiers have the correct radios and they're set to the right channel. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure the uniforms are what they should be. A lot of times updates will break classnames and soldiers will have default A3 uniforms. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure the uniforms are positive identification friendly. If you can't tell what team is which from 100m, there's probably a problem. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure every soldier type (I.E. FTL/AR/AAR/AT) has medical supplies. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Check for soldiers with magnified optics, and make sure the mission maker has both A) Intended this and B) has properly balanced it. : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[spoiler=Vehicles Checklist + Notes]

[list]

[*]Ensure vehicle gear is correct for the side using it (Mainly for COOPs), or removed (mainly for TvTs). :  [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure the vehicles are balanced (I.E. if one team has a BTR, one team has the AT to kill it, or if two teams are racing to an objectives, their vics go about the same speed). : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]

[*]Ensure vehicles with weapons have their ammo balanced, (I.E. a Little Bird with 32 rockets is overkill vs infantry). : [color=#00FF00]X[/color]
